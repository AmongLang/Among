# AMONG: Absolutely Mental Object Notation (G is silent (that's how acronyms work right?))

**Among** is JSON-inspired data expression format for general data structures. It is designed to be easy-to-write format for users, while preserving structural soundness and broad applicability of JSON.

The features of **Among** include...
* Clean syntax that eliminates most of redundant characters compared to JSON.
* Macros, which makes data easier to view for humans and reduces repetition to minimum.
* Operations and user definable operators and keywords, which gets parsed to syntax tree. It provides capability of expressing equations or code, and even an ability to create domain-specific language fully enclosed within the range of the core language itself.
* And absolutely cringeworthy naming which will brighten your everyday life!
